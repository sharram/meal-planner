OneStopGo is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to streamline meal planning and encourage healthier eating habits. The platform provides an intuitive interface for users to explore, create, and manage recipes tailored to a variety of dietary needs and preferences.

Users can register and log in to personalize their experience, contribute new recipes with detailed descriptions and images, and browse meals based on categories such as diabetes-friendly, PCOS diets, and workout meals. The application also features a “Contact Us” section, which captures user feedback and stores it securely in the database for effective backend management.

Enhanced interactivity is achieved through features like expandable recipe cards and recipe deletion, making the platform both user-friendly and dynamic. By integrating thoughtful front-end design with robust back-end architecture, OneStopGo offers a responsive and engaging experience that promotes better meal planning and community-driven recipe sharing.
